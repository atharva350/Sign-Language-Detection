# Sign-Language-Detection
Sign Language Detection is a ML based project made for third year engineering.

# Overview
Welcome to the Sign Language Detection project! This repository contains the source code for a mini-project developed during the third year of engineering. The project leverages computer vision and machine learning to identify hand symbols corresponding to the 26 English alphabets and types the detected text on the screen. Users can interact with the system through a web interface, using hand gestures to input text, which can be saved, edited, deleted, or converted to speech.

# Features
-> **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Detects hand symbols for all 26 English alphabets and converts them to text.<br />
-> **Custom Dataset:** Created a custom dataset of hand symbols using computer vision and Python.<br />
-> **Model Training:** Trained a machine learning classifier using Python.<br />
-> **User Authentication:** Users can log in to the website to access features.<br />
-> **Camera Integration:** Users can start their camera to type text using hand gestures.<br />
-> **Notes Management:** Users can save typed text as notes, and edit or delete them from the dashboard.<br />
-> **Text-to-Speech:** Converts typed text into speech.<br />
-> **Responsive Design:** Ensures compatibility with various devices.

# Technologies Used
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br />
**Backend:** Flask framework using Python<br />
**Database:** MySQL<br />
**Machine Learning:** Python (with relevant libraries for computer vision and machine learning)

# Usage
-> **Sign Up / Log In:** Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.<br />
->**Start Camera:** Navigate to the camera page and start your camera to begin detecting hand gestures.<br />
->**Type with Gestures:** Use hand gestures to type text on the screen.<br />
->**Manage Notes:** Save typed text as notes, and edit or delete them from the dashboard.<br />
->**Text-to-Speech:** Convert typed text into speech using the text-to-speech feature.
